# Caritas Kosova & Mother Teresa Society Data Management Platform API

This repository contains the backend API for the Data Management Systems developed for Caritas Kosova (CK) and Mother Teresa Society (MTS). The system is designed to centralize program-related data, facilitate offline data collection, enable real-time monitoring, and provide reporting and analysis tools.

## System Architecture

- **Backend Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Application Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit

## Features

- User Management with Role-Based Access Control
- Program Management with multi-tier hierarchy
- Beneficiary Management
- Data Collection and Activity Tracking
- Offline Data Collection via PWA
- Reporting and Dashboards
- Statistics and Analytics
- Audit Logs and System Monitoring
